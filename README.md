# Pandas PyCity Schools Challenge

This challenge deals with the Pandas Challenge + the analysis provided after answering the questions based off the PyCity Schools challenge. This dataset looked at 15 schools that were either Charter or District Schools 


As mentioned above this dataset looked at the certain schools (15 schools in total) and we as analysts calculated the average math, reading, passing percentages of math and reading and the overall passing grade of each school. We then presented them in a dataframe to analyze. From our findings it showed that the charter schools, clearly outperformed the district schools, even though the spending per student was roughly the same. After doing more analysis, it showed that the number of students in District schools were far greater than the number in Charter Schools. This is where I believe the big difference was, as Charter schools, teachers are able to focus their attention to each individual students more easily. At District schools, this is much tougher
